Many different kinds of thoughts came in my mind which gave rise to my absent-mindedness.

Recently, some books and movies touched my soul. Who I am? Where should I go to? What's the mean of life? Many things are waiting for me. I know I must solve them. 

Though many theories tortured me, the positive blueprint about future is clear than ever.
All roads lead to Roma and I know where is Roma. I have selected some roads which could 
guide me to achieve my goals.
