The holiday will be over soon.

I did some things unplaned. 

And some things which had to be done was not done.

Anything, as long as you concentrate on doing it, you may be able to do the utmost.
 
I believe it. No matter how small this thing is.

But in most cases, we lack focus and persistence. Therefore, we became a common person.

In our whole limited life, Even if we do one thing, it is already very great. Because most people have nothing in their lives.

Find something that deserves your attention and live through this short and glorious life. EXPERT.
