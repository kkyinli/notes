# About anxiety

I don't think it a good sigh for my recently dysphoric. I can't figure out the reason. But I feel the pressure. I dislike it. But I can't expel them.

So I try to figure out what happened to me recently?

What caused my anxiety?

What makes me worried?

How could I solve them?

Xiaobo Wang had said, the origin of pain comes from the scarce capacity. I did.

So, the best way to  conquer this unpleasant emotion is to empower myself.

Work hard, Kelly.
