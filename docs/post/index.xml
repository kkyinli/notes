      <description>About anxiety I don&amp;rsquo;t think it a good sigh for my recently dysphoric. I can&amp;rsquo;t figure out the reason. But I feel the pressure. I dislike it. But I can&amp;rsquo;t expel them.
So I try to figure out what happened to me recently?
What caused my anxiety?
What makes me worried?
How could I solve them?

      <description>OUT OF MIND Many different kinds of thoughts came in my mind which gave rise to my absent-mindedness.
Recently, some books and movies touched my soul. Who I am? Where should I go to? What&amp;rsquo;s the mean of life? Many things are waiting for me. I know I must solve them.
Though many theories tortured me, the positive blueprint about future is clear than ever. All roads lead to Roma and I know where is Roma.</description>
